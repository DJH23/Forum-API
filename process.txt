### 1. Setup Spring Boot Project

**Initial Setup**:
- Use **Spring Initializr** (start.spring.io) to create a Spring Boot project. Select dependencies like Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, MySQL Driver, and Spring Security.
- Configure the database connection in `application.properties` or `application.yml`.

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/forumdb
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
```

### 2. Model Design and Relationships

Given a forum, you might consider models such as `User`, `Thread`, `Post`, and potentially `Comment` if you want hierarchical interactions within posts.

**Parent/Child Relationships**:
- **Thread**: Composed of multiple posts.
- **Post**: Can include comments (if implementing comments as a separate entity).

**Example Entity Setup**:

```java
@Entity
public class Thread {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    private String title;
    private String description;

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "user_id", nullable = false)
    private User user;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "thread", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)
    private List<Post> posts = new ArrayList<>();
    // getters and setters
}

@Entity
public class Post {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    private String content;

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "thread_id", nullable = false)
    private Thread thread;

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "user_id", nullable = false)
    private User user;
    // getters and setters
}
```

### 3. Repository Layer

Create repositories using Spring Data JPA for each entity:

```java
@Repository
public interface ThreadRepository extends JpaRepository<Thread, Long> {}

@Repository
public interface PostRepository extends JpaRepository<Post, Long> {}
```

### 4. Service Layer

Implement the business logic in service classes:

```java
@Service
public class ThreadService {
    @Autowired
    private ThreadRepository threadRepository;

    public List<Thread> findAllThreads() {
        return threadRepository.findAll();
    }

    public Thread saveThread(Thread thread) {
        return threadRepository.save(thread);
    }
    // Add more methods as needed for CRUD operations
}

@Service
public class PostService {
    @Autowired
    private PostRepository postRepository;

    public List<Post> findAllPostsByThread(Long threadId) {
        return postRepository.findByThreadId(threadId);
    }
    // Implement other CRUD operations
}
```

### 5. Controller Layer

Define the RESTful endpoints:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/threads")
public class ThreadController {
    @Autowired
    private ThreadService threadService;

    @GetMapping
    public List<Thread> getAllThreads() {
        return threadService.findAllThreads();
    }

    @PostMapping
    public Thread createThread(@RequestBody Thread thread) {
        return threadService.saveThread(thread);
    }

    // Add more endpoints as necessary
}
```

### 6. Configure Spring Security for JWT Authentication

- Implement JWT token creation and parsing utilities.
- Customize the `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` to use JWT in requests:

```java
@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
        .csrf().disable()
        .authorizeRequests()
        .antMatchers("/api/**").authenticated()
        .anyRequest().permitAll()
        .and()
        .addFilterBefore(new JWTAuthenticationFilter(),
                UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class)
        .sessionManagement().sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS);
}
```

### Project Plan for Forum API - Business-Focused Backlog

#### Objective:
Develop a comprehensive Forum API that enables seamless, scalable interactions between users, enhancing user engagement and community building features for our client's digital platforms.

#### Main Task: Enhanced User Management System
**Abstract Task Definition**:
Implement an advanced user management system to empower administrators with robust controls for user moderation and community engagement.

**Business Description**:
- **Administrator Features**:
  1. **User Onboarding**: Enable administrators to register new users, setting up accounts that users can then personalize and use.
  2. **User Modification**: Administrators can update user information to ensure profiles remain current and reflective of user identities.
  3. **User Status Management**: Provide tools for administrators to deactivate, reactivate, or permanently block users based on adherence to the community's code of conduct.

#### Specific Features (Sub-Tasks):

- **1. Integrate User Management into Forum API**:
  - Develop the necessary end-points to interact with the existing User model in the system.
  - API endpoints to handle CRUD operations for User management by administrators.
  - Ensure these operations are securely accessible only by users with admin privileges.

- **2. User Role and Permission Management**:
  - Design and implement role-based access control within the forum to restrict or allow access to various functionalities.
  - Provide endpoints for assigning roles to users and altering these roles as necessary.

- **3. User Activity Monitoring and Reporting**:
  - Facilitate the creation of logs related to user actions within the forum to monitor activity and enforce the code of conduct.
  - Develop an interface for administrators to query and view reports of user activity.

- **4. User Authentication & Security Enhancements**:
  - Utilize existing mechanisms or enhance the security features ensuring secure login, data transmission, and storage for user information.
  - Implement measures such as rate limiting and data encryption.

- **5. Compliance and User Conduct Enforcement**:
  - Create tools and processes for administrators to enforce the code of conduct, including temporary suspensions or permanent bans.
  - Automate certain aspects of compliance monitoring through machine learning or rule-based algorithms to identify potential violations.

#### Planning and Timeline:
Outline the steps for Project Management:
- **Initial Planning and Requirements Gathering**: Engage with stakeholders to refine feature details and prioritizations (1 week).
- **Development Sprints**:
   - Sprint 1: Basic User Management Functions.
   - Sprint 2: Advanced Role Management and Permissions.
   - Sprint 3: Security Features and Compliance Tools.
- **Testing & Quality Assurance**: Iterative testing alongside development sprints (continuous).
- **Deployment and Go-Live**: Final testing and deployment (1 week after last development sprint).
- **Training & Support**: Provide training materials and sessions for administrators (concurrent with deployment phase).

- **Ongoing Maintenance and Updates**: Establish a schedule for periodic reviews and updates.

### Conclusion:
This structured approach aligns development tasks with business goals, presenting the forum API project not just as a technical endeavor but as a strategic asset for the client, focused on enhancing user experience and administrative efficiency. This method draws the client into the development process as a participant understanding the value of each feature from a business perspective.



### Roles
1. **Administrator**:
   - Typically has full control over the forum, including both management of content and user accounts.
   - Permissions might include managing (create, read, update, delete) all threads, posts, comments, user accounts, roles, and permissions.

2. **Moderator**:
   - Focuses on maintaining the quality of content and ensuring that community guidelines are followed.
   - Permissions often include editing, deleting, or hiding posts and comments, and possibly suspending users for guideline violations.

3. **Registered User**:
   - Standard users who can create content and participate in discussions.
   - Permissions typically involve creating, editing, and deleting their own posts and comments depending on forum rules.

4. **Free User**:
   - Limited to reading content, with no permission to create posts, comments, or participate in other interactive functionalities.
